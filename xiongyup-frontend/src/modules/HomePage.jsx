                <p>
                    Hi, my name is YuPheng Xiong I am currently a CS student at OSU. I am currently working on 
                    completing my BA degree. Something that I have learned so far that was able to help me get
                    through school, was to find something else to relax the mind, such as gaming, watching a video,
                    or even something outside. I would say a word that would describe me is self critic. Basically
                    meaning that I tend to think of doing not enough.

                            <dt>HTML (Front End Design)</dt>
                            <dd>
                                HTMl was one of the most basic programming language to start off with,
                                 but it was exciting. The main function of HTML is to allow the ability
                                 to create dialog, insert links, and many more.
                            </dd>

                            <dt>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) </dt>
                            <dd>
                                CSS is used for styling section of a html/jsx file, that is outside of
                                 file. It allows overwriting any design that happens buy default or 
                                 within the file. Which helped create a design that matches our environment we
                                 want users to feel and see.

                                JavaScript is a code language that in course CS290 we used as our code for our backend
                                 programming. This includes functions, variables, and etc. This language was
                                 in my opinion really fun to learn, but with some of the functionality of where the 
                                 names and labels needed to be exact, in order for certain call function to work was
                                 a hassle. However, it was a fun language to learn and start learning.

                                <q><strong>M</strong></q> stands for MongleDB, which was used to help our backend system, 
                                 to store variables that would be used in our frontend program. Its a separate software
                                 that is needed in our program to allow storage of data, and access to those data.

                                <q><strong>E</strong></q> stands for Express.js, which is a framework of the backend system,
                                 consisting of code, variable, and etc. These are used as the backbone of an API, which are
                                 crucial to having the system being able to run.

                                <q><strong>R</strong></q> stands for React, which is used for our frontend system. React is 
                                 used for the face of our web having a library and also being used as our UI interface. This
                                 allows users to interact with our program with clicking, tapping and typing information to
                                 navigate through our web page.

                                <q><strong>N</strong></q> stands for Node which was used in our program to allow JavaScript testing
                                 of our program through servers, that would typically be outside the browser. This would allow the 
                                 developers to see their web pages out in a tab, rather than working within our terminal.
